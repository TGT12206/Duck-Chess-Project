This implementation of duck chess will be used by our group to build and test a duck chess bot (based on alpha beta pruning and/or monte carlo tree search. we'll see)

For now, we only have the base game, and the rest of the file is specifically written by Thomas Tran.

I have uploaded the current version of the game to this link, and you can play it in the browser: https://tgt12206.itch.io/duck-chess

I made this based off of the github repository provided by Sebastian Lague in this video​​: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk

His repository has an MIT license, and while I didn't directly copy all of the code, I did use 2 or 3 files nearly unchanged, and took significant inspiration from the rest. Therefore, this project also has the MIT license.

I wanted to work from an implementation of chess and nothing more, but the repository was very large and interconnected, so I couldn't easily separate the main game from the AI or Utility classes.

Instead, I ended up using it as a guide for making my own codebase, rather than building off of it. Plus, duck chess has different rules that it was worth re-creating from scratch.
